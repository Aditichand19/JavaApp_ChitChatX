# What each section means:
#.idea/, *.iml: IntelliJ's internal config – not needed on GitHub
#
#*.class: compiled .java files – you only upload source code, not compiled output
#
#out/, build/: generated files or folders during run/build
#
#chatlog2.txt: your server log file – skip this unless you want to show logs
#
#.DS_Store, Thumbs.db: created by Mac/Windows file systems – useless in repo
